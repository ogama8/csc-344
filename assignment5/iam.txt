I do not know who I am, yet I desperately want self-definition.

I am trying to get us to abandon that terminology.

I am saying something inconsistent.

I am a nonimmigrant.

I am who I say I am.

I am an employer.

I am not there. I do not sleep.

I am energized by students, encouraged by staff and inspired by colleagues.

I am speaking to a microphone, broadcasting my despair, but I hear no response.

I am sorry I was not here to hear your whole testimony. I am listening now.

I am not sophisticated but simple, concentrated, and friendly.

I am not well trained in smile but always curious and want to help others.

I am a little bit afraid that it might sound noisy to you.

I am a fan of art, especially interested in the Renaissance period and I myself make drawings, water and oil paintings.

I am never afraid of facing challenges and difficulties.

I am the person that I am because of my birth culture.

I like who I am.

I am a star.

I am not a lawyer and do not give legal advice.

I am a student.

I am frustrated by the violence in the Middle East, and so are a lot of people who live in the Middle East.

I am not likely to be impressed by the same thing over and over again.

I am not a visual designer.

I am acting just like a man.

I am not sick, I don't need help.

I am a Visitor.

I am sorry for every time I made you cry.
